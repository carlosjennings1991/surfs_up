# Surfs Up

For this analysis, we look at the climatic conditions for opening a surfing goods & ice cream store. Specifically, we want to know if this store will be viable year round. For instance, when it's raining for long stretches at a time, you might have a few hard-core surfers buying gear, but very few customers for ice cream. 

We also know that people buy ice cream when it's hot out. Hot out and *not raining*. Conversely, ideal surfing conditions (i.e big waves) are positively correlated with wind speed and wind speed is positively correlated with rainfall. So in essense, we are looking for the goldilocks happy-medium which will be conducive for both sides of the business. To summarize in bullet points, we are looking for this info: 

</br>

* **Monthly Rainfall in June (indicative of dry season)**
* **Monthly Rainfall in December (rainy of rainy season)**
* **Monthly Temperature for June**
* **Monthly Temperature for December**

</br>

All analysis and charts were created in jupyter notebook, using a combination of Python and SqLite. Source code found [here](https://github.com/carlosjennings1991/surfs_up/blob/main/SurfsUp_Challenge.ipynb)
