# Surfs Up

For this analysis, we look at the climatic conditions for opening a surfing goods & ice cream store. Specifically, we want to know if this store will be viable year round. For instance, when it's raining for long stretches at a time, you might have a few hard-core surfers buying gear, but very few customers for ice cream. 

We also know that people buy ice cream when it's hot out. Hot out and *not raining*. Conversely, ideal surfing conditions (i.e big waves) are positively correlated with wind speed and wind speed is positively correlated with rainfall. So in essense, we are looking for the goldilocks happy-medium which will be conducive for both sides of the business. To summarize in bullet points, we are looking for this info:

* Monthly Rainfall in June (indicative of dry season)
* Monthly Rainfall in December (rainy of rainy season)
